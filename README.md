# JSbookmarks
This repository contains a collection of my random javascript projects that work in the Chrome Browser.

To use them, simply download this project and drag and drop the links from the "links.html" file into your Bookmarks Bar.

Oh, almost forgot, some of these, such as the InfiniteWindows program have a possibility to mess stuff up on your computer, so I am not responsible for that if that happens.

Have a nice day!

:)
